# MongoDb_Cluster
Plugin for monitoring MongoDb Cluster
==============================================

This plugin monitors the metrics of MongoDb Cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] / [Site24x7 Windows agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 
		
- Create a cluster in https://www.mongodb.com and get your public_key and private_key to access API.

### Plugin Installation

- Create a directory "mongodb_cluster" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory : 

      Linux             ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/mongodb_cluster

---
      
- Download all the files in "mongodb_cluster" folder and place it under the "mongodb_cluster" directory

	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/mongodb_cluster/mongodb_cluster.py
	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/mongodb_cluster/mongodb_cluster.cfg

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

		python mongodb_cluster.py --group_id=<your_group_id> --public_key=<your_public_key> --private_key=<your_private_key>


The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.


### Configurations

group_id =<your_group_id>
public_key =<your_public_key>
private_key =<your_private_key>
